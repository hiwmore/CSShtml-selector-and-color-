            <p>The course provides basic skills and knowledge in web development. We work partially in teams of 2-4 participants in each team and partially individually. The course will often be project based where most of the teaching is online. Online teaching will sometimes alternate with guest lectures online as well as two physical meetings at Sundsgårdens Folkhögskola. Together we will learn about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the teams will then be able to deepen their understanding and sharpen their skills within these areas of web development.</p>

            <p>What is "programming"? Programming refers to the process of creating instructions for a computer to execute. These instructions are written in a programming language, which is a formal language that defines a set of rules for how to write computer programs.</p>

            <p>Coding empowers us to create software, websites, mobile applications, and various digital tools that enhance our daily lives. From the social media platforms we use to stay connected to the navigation apps that guide us on our journeys, coding is the driving force behind the technology we rely on. </p>

            <p>Coding and programming are often used interchangeably, but there's a subtle distinction between the two terms. Coding refers to the process of converting human-readable instructions into a form that computers can understand. It involves translating ideas and algorithms into a specific programming language, following its syntax and rules. Coders primarily focus on writing code that executes specific tasks or solves particular problems.</p>
        <section>
            <p>On the other hand, programming encompasses a broader scope. It involves the entire process of developing software or applications, from conceptualizing and designing the solution to testing and maintaining the final product. Programmers not only write code but also analyze requirements, design algorithms, debug errors, and ensure the overall functionality and efficiency of the software.</p>
